# Python for Linguists: exercises

This repository hosts exercises for the BA Linguistcs course **Python for linguists** in Leiden, not to be confused with the course **Language for pythons**.

Aimed at linguistics students with no programming experience, the exercises are designed to foster:

- [x] Gradual discovery of the Python language.
- [x] Practical skills, i.e., **how** to get stuff done.
- [x] Conceptual understanding, i.e., **why** to do it _that_ way.
- [x] Acquisition of powerful coding habits and way of thinking.

Start with the first file and slowly work your way down, as the exercises are strongly incremental, both within each file and between files. It is difficult to foresee how fast/slow we will be going in this course, so homework targets will be determined week by week.

The files are still awaiting a final round of proofreading and are subject to change. Moreover, additional files with new sections will appear later. To ensure you are looking at the latest version, simply keep coming here in your browser rather than downloading the files to your computer.

_**What are .md files?** These files are formatted with **markdown**. Github automatically displays them with a nice layout, and the PyCharm IDE which we will use provides similar support, in case you do want to download the files. However, opening these files in any other editor will likely not yield the prettiest results._
