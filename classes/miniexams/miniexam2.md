Using pen-and-paper only, write a program that does the following:

1. It asks the user to enter their age in years.			(2 points)
2. It prints whether their age is an even or an odd number.  	(4 points)
3. It prints whether their age has an even digit or not (e.g., 27 has an even digit, namely 2).  (4 points)

Notes:
- You may assume the age will have exactly two digits.
- Advice: store each individual digit in a separate variable before any 'if-else'.
- Use correct Python syntax including indentation, capitalization, etc.


Example output:
```
Enter your age:   (user enters:)  25
Your age is odd.
It has an even digit.
```
