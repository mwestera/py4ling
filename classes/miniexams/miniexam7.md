Write down all the **printed output** of the program below. Pay attention: 

- Write the output as printed by executing the program _as a whole_, not line-by-line.
- The code _may or may not_ give an error. If so, write down whatever is printed _until_ the error is encountered, followed by 'Error'.

```python
name = 'alf'

print(name)

def first_function(name, upper=True):
    print(name)
    if upper:
        name = name.upper()
    print(name)

def second_function():
    name.upper()

first_function(name)
print(name)
first_function('beth', False)
second_function()
print(name)
third_function()

def third_function():
    print(name)
```
