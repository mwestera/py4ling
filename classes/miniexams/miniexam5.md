Write a function `analyze_strings` that takes a list of strings and prints some statistics:

- The total number of strings in the list (elements of the list).
- The length, and number of vowels, of each _individual_ string.
- The _total_ length and _total_ number of vowels of all strings taken together.

You are free to do this in a single, self-contained function, or to define auxiliary functions.
