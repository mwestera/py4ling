# Python for Linguists

## Class 5
1. Mini-exam 4 + discussion
2. Admin: homework time? (~5 hours); past mini-exams; solutions uploaded
3. Adventure: Finalize COVID adventure (is_about_vaccine, emoji_sentiment)
---break---
4. ~~Discuss homework (7.24, 7.37, 8.9, 8.10; maybe also mutability (7.21, 7.22, 7.23))~~
5. Adventure: Concreteness and correlation
6. Homework for next time: Exercises 8.11-9.9 (loops)
  - Also: Explore the COVID and/or concreteness adventure code. It would be good (for the future) to at least try to make the code run on your computer.
  - Also: Consider revising previous homework if you have some time left.
  - For all other questions, see office hours/forum.
